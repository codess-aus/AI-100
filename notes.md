Text Moderation API:

* A list of potentially unwanted words found in the text.
* What type of potentially unwanted words were found.
* Possible personally identifiable information (PII) found in the text.

With the Text Moderation API, you can:

* Analyze text to look for unwanted content.
* Classify the potentially offensive content.
* Get insights into the potential PII that's being shared so that you can protect it.

LUIS:

LUIS makes use of three key aspects for understanding language:

Utterances: An utterance is input from the user that your app needs to interpret.
Intents: An intent represents a task or action the user wants to do. It's a purpose or goal expressed in a user's utterance.
Entities: An entity represents a word or phrase inside the utterance that you want to extract.
